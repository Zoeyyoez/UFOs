### UFOs 

## About 

This project aims to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings, and design the layout of a webpage in a storytelling way. 


## Objective

The goals for this project is to 
    1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters;
    2. Update and deploy forEach(for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input; And 
    3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML. 

## Technologies Used 

    1. HTML/CSS
    2. JavaScript
    3. Bootstrap


## Recommendation for Further Development 

One recommendation that I have for further development is that we can add a sort function on the website to make the results more selectable.
